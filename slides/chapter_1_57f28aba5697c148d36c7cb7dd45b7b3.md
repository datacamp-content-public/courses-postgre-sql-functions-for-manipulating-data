## Functions for manipulating date/time data

`@script`
In the previous lesson, you learned about the AGE function and how to use it to calculate the difference between two timestamps.

Now let's take a look at how we can use the EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions to manipulate timestamp data and create new columns by extracting sub-fields from existings date/time values.

This type of data manipulation is useful when you want to use parts of date/time variables like year or month in your queries but the underlying data only contains a standard timestamp value.

## Extracting sub-fields from timestamp data

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "6ffbf49ebc"
```

Transactional data from DVD Rentals _payment_ table{{1}}

Data from _payment_ table aggregated by year and quarter{{2}}

`@script`
In our DVD Rentals database, every customer rental has a corresponding record in the payment table and each transaction is recorded with a timestamp in the payment_date column as the snippet below highlights. This level of detail is certainly necessary for an e-commerce application, but there will no doubt be times when you will want to be able to aggregate this data to use for training a model, reporting and/or trend analysis.

For example, you may want to identify the highest revenue by quarter using a query that produces a data set similar to the one you see here.  This snippet shows total_payments by year and quarter.

## EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "def2c782e4"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- The **```EXTRACT(field FROM source)```**  and **```DATE_PART('field', source)```** functions retrieve subfields such as year or hour from date/time values. {{1}}

- Where **_field_** is an identifer or string that specifies what subfield you want to extract from the **_source_** which is a valid _timestamp_, _time_ or _interval_ data type {{2}}

- The following are valid **_field_** names: century, day, decade, dow, doy, epoch, hour, isodow, isoyear, microseconds, millennium, milliseconds, minute, month, quarter, second, timezone, timezone_hour, timezone_minute, week, year. {{3}}


`@script`
This is where the EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions come in very handy. To use these funtions in your queries you will need to pass two parameters.

The field parameter is an identifier (or string if you are using DATE_PART) that indicates what sub-field that you want to extract from the source.  The various field identifiers include year, month, quarter, day of week, etc.

The source parameter needs to be a valid timestamp, time or interval data type. 

Both EXTRACT and DATE_PART will produce identical results and are very similar with only slight variations in how you pass in the field and source parameters.  For the remainder of this exercise we will focus primarily on the EXTRACT function.

Now, let's get into some examples and see this in action.

## Some EXTRACT examples

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "bb9c1caa9d"
```

`@part1`
Using the **_EXTRACT_** function to aggregate _payment_ data by _quarter_

`SELECT EXTRACT(quarter FROM TIMESTAMP '2005-01-24 05:12:00') as quarter`{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4340/datasets/d779e7bf853074f2f1e7ebead691aeaa80d5a134/quarter.png){{1}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) as year, EXTRACT(quarter FROM payment_date) as quarter, SUM(amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1, 2`{{2}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4340/datasets/dd47e6f26ebcb1baeec5ddad8eea0fe8bfb322cd/aggregate_payments.png){{2}}


`@script`
Using EXTRACT, you can easily create a new field in your queries called quarter that will give you a numeric value for the quarter of the source timestamp.  Here's a simple example. 

The result from executing this query will return the number one as you might expect.

Now suppose we want to use our DVD Rentals database to produce a predictive model that will help us forecast quarterly revenue. We could use the EXTRACT function in our query to create two new fields called "year" and "quarter" as sub-fields of the payment_date column from the payment table.  And if we SUM the amount column and aggregate by the two newly create year and quarter columns, we will get the following result.

## Some more EXTRACT examples

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "bcc68b8d0c"
```

`@part1`
An example using an _interval_ data type instead of a _timestamp_{{1}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(hour, INTERVAL '4 hours 3 minutes')`{{1}}
 
And finally, one last example using day of the week{{2}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(dow FROM rental_date) as dayofweek, COUNT(rental_id) as total_rentals FROM rental WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM rental_date) = 2005 GROUP BY 1`{{2}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4340/datasets/d3df5eac740a4d82efcdaa2d9dd1fe6696ee1cca/interval.png){{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4340/datasets/8aba2571ee8e7c57cc047cf1561639da7ea62e48/dow.png){{2}}


`@script`
The EXTRACT function an also be used on interval data types in addition to timestamps.  In this example, the extract function will return the number 4.  

One last example of EXTRACT is Day of the Week.  Let's say we want to create a model that predicts customer demand measured by total number of rentals by day of the week in the year 2005.  We can use the EXTRACT function and the rental table to do this.

Notice that we are also using the EXTRACT function in our WHERE clause in this example to filter the rental data to only include rentals from 2006.

## Using DATE_PART instead

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "96381e10c2"
```

`@part1`
`SELECT DATE_PART('quarter' FROM TIMESTAMP '2005-01-24 05:12:00') as quarter`

`SELECT DATE_PART('quarter', payment_date) as quarter, DATE_PART('year', payment_date) as year, SUM( amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1,2`

`SELECT EXTRACT(hour, INTERVAL '4 hours 3 minutes')`

`SELECT DATE_PART('dow', payment_date) as dayofweek, SUM(amount) as total_payment FROM payment WHERE DATE_PART('year', payment_date) = 2006 GROUP BY 1`


`@script`
As we talked about at the beginning of the lesson, the DATE_PART function can be used interchangeably with EXTRACT.  Here's each example query that we saw in this lesson, using DATE_PART instead.
