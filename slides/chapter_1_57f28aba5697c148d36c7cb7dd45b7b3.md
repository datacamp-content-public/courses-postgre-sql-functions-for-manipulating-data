## EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "def2c782e4"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- The **```EXTRACT(field FROM source)```**  and **```DATE_PART('field', source)```** functions retrieve subfields such as year or hour from date/time values. 

- Where **_field_** is an identifer or string that specifies what subfield you want to extract from the **_source_** which is a valid _timestamp_, _time_ or _interval_ data type

- The following are valid **_field_** names: century, day, decade, dow, doy, epoch, hour, isodow, isoyear, microseconds, millennium, milliseconds, minute, month, quarter, second, timezone, timezone_hour, timezone_minute, week, year.

## Some examples

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "bb9c1caa9d"
```

`@part1`
Now, using EXTRACT, you can easily create a new column called quarter that will give you a numeric value for the quarter in a given year.

`EXTRACT( quarter FROM payment_date) as quater`

You could also do the same thing for years and get a usable result over mulitple quarters and years

`SELECT EXTRACT( quarter FROM payment_date) as quater, EXTRACT ( year FROM payment_date) as year, SUM( amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1, 2`

You could also use DATE_PART To do the same thing

SELECT DATE_PART( 'quarter', payment_date) as quater, DATE_PART( 'year', payment_date) as year, SUM( amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1,2
