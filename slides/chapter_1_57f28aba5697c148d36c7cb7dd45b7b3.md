## EXTRACT and DATE_PART functions

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "def2c782e4"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- The **```EXTRACT(field FROM source)```**  and **```DATE_PART('field', source)```** functions retrieve subfields such as year or hour from date/time values. 

- Where **_field_** is an identifer or string that specifies what subfield you want to extract from the **_source_** which is a valid _timestamp_, _time_ or _interval_ data type

- The following are valid **_field_** names: century, day, decade, dow, doy, epoch, hour, isodow, isoyear, microseconds, millennium, milliseconds, minute, month, quarter, second, timezone, timezone_hour, timezone_minute, week, year.

## Some EXTRACT examples

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "bb9c1caa9d"
```

`@part1`
Using the EXTRACT function to aggregate payment data by quarter

`SELECT EXTRACT(quarter FROM TIMESTAMP '2005-01-24 05:12:00') as quarter`{{1}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) as year, EXTRACT(quarter FROM payment_date) as quarter, SUM(amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1, 2`{{2}}


`@script`

## Some more EXTRACT examples

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "984f692c6b"
```

`@part1`
An example using an _interval_ data type instead of a _timestamp_{{1}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(hour, INTERVAL '4 hours 3 minutes')`{{1}}

And finally, one last example using day of the week{{2}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(dow FROM payment_date) as dayofweek, SUM(amount) as total_payment FROM payment WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM payment_date) = 2006 GROUP BY 1`{{2}}


`@script`



---
## Using DATE_PART instead

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "96381e10c2"
```

`@part1`
`SELECT DATE_PART('quarter' FROM TIMESTAMP '2005-01-24 05:12:00') as quarter`{{1}}

`SELECT DATE_PART('quarter', payment_date) as quarter, DATE_PART('year', payment_date) as year, SUM( amount) as total_payments FROM payment GROUP by 1,2`{{2}}

`SELECT EXTRACT(hour, INTERVAL '4 hours 3 minutes')`{{3}}

`SELECT DATE_PART('dow', payment_date) as dayofweek, SUM(amount) as total_payment FROM payment WHERE DATE_PART('year', payment_date) = 2006 GROUP BY 1`{{4}}
